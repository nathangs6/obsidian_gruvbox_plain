# Plain Obsidian Gruvbox

This is a [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) based on that of [insanum](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_gruvbox). This version removes some of the special colouring that I did not like in insanum's version. For example, I have made each heading a consistent colour and removed the colours of highlighted and bolded text.
